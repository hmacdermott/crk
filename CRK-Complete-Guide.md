## Elemental Synergy & Strategy

### Why Elements Matter

1. **Increased Damage:** Enemies vulnerable to specific elements take amplified damage
2. **Team Buffs:** Many cookies boost allies of the same element
3. **Elemental Beascuits:** Provide significant damage bonuses when matched correctly
4. **Game Mode Requirements:** Cookie Alliance and certain stages require specific elements

### Building Elemental Teams

**Key Principles:**
- **Millennial Tree Cookie** gains significant buffs when teamed with 4+ different elemental cookies
- **Elemental-specific buffers** (e.g., Sea Fairy for Water, Fire Spirit for Fire) greatly amplify team damage
- **Elemental beascuits** grant 20% damage boost for matching element cookies

**Popular Elemental Team Compositions:**

- **Water Team:** Sea Fairy + Black Pearl + Captain Caviar + Frilled Jellyfish + Sorbet Shark (high synergy)
- **Fire Team:** Fire Spirit + Burning Spice + Capsaicin + Pitaya Dragon (massive damage output)
- **Earth Team:** Golden Cheese + Burnt Cheese + Smoked Cheese + Espresso (excellent for Cookie Alliance)
- **Electricity Team:** Stormbringer + Wizard + Twizzly Gummy + Blueberry Pie + Dark Cacao (Current Charge synergy)

## Tips for Building Your Team

### Composition Fundamentals

1. **Balance is Key:** Include at least one tank (Charge/Defense), one healer (Healing), and damage dealers
2. **Position Matters:** Front cookies absorb damage, middle provides utility, rear deals safe damage
3. **Element Diversity:** Mix elements for Millennial Tree synergy or focus on one element for specialized teams
4. **Cooldown Management:** Ensure healers and supports have 20%+ cooldown reduction for consistent uptime

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Over-investing in non-elemental DPS:** Cookies without elements miss out on beascuit bonuses
- **Neglecting cooldown on supports:** Low cooldown means longer gaps in crucial buffs/heals
- **Ignoring DMG Resist on tanks:** Tanks need 40-50% DMG Resist minimum to survive endgame content
- **Building multiple low-tier cookies:** Focus resources on meta and versatile cookies first

### Resource Priority

**Early Game (Kingdom Level 1-30):**
- Focus on one team of 5 cookies
- Prioritize Epic rarity cookies with elements
- Invest in: Espresso, Cotton, Pumpkin Pie, Dark Choco, Eclair

**Mid Game (Kingdom Level 31-50):**
- Diversify for different game modes
- Build PvP and PvE specialized teams
- Target: One Ancient, one Legendary, strong Epic lineup

**Late Game (Kingdom Level 50+):**
- Focus on Awakened Ancients, Beasts, and Super Epics
- Min-max toppings and beascuits
- Build elemental-focused teams for Cookie Alliance

## Special Notes

**Agar Agar Cookie:** This unique cookie mirrors the element of Legendary cookies on your team. When paired with Sea Fairy (Water), Fire Spirit (Fire), Frost Queen (Ice), Stormbringer (Electricity), or Wind Archer (Wind), Agar Agar gains that element for elemental synergy.
