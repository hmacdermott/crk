# Adding Cookie Images

This guide explains how to add cookie images to your Cookie Run: Kingdom Reference Guide.

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG or JPG recommended
- **Size**: Any size will work (images are automatically scaled to 80x80px)
- **Quality**: Higher resolution looks better when zoomed

## File Naming Convention

Images must be named using this format:
- **Capitalize first letter of each word**
- **Replace spaces with underscores (_)**
- **Remove "Cookie" from the end**
- **Add `_illustration.webp`**

### Examples:

| Cookie Name | File Name |
|-------------|-----------|
| Affogato Cookie | `Affogato_illustration.webp` |
| Dark Cacao Cookie | `Dark_cacao_illustration.webp` |
| Captain Caviar Cookie | `Captain_caviar_illustration.webp` |
| Crunchy Chip Cookie | `Crunchy_chip_illustration.webp` |

### Special Cases:

| Cookie Name | File Name |
|-------------|-----------|
| Dark Cacao Cookie (Dragon Lord) | `Awakened_dark_cacao_illustration.webp` |
| Golden Cheese Cookie (Immortal) | `Awakened_golden_cheese_illustration.webp` |
| Pure Vanilla Cookie (Compassionate) | `Awakened_pure_vanilla_illustration.webp` |
| Hollyberry Cookie (Aegis) | `Awakened_hollyberry_illustration.webp` |
| White Lily Cookie (Dawnbringer) | `Awakened_white_lily_illustration.webp` |
| Dark Enchantress Cookie | `Dark-enchantress-cookie.webp` |
| Millennial Tree Cookie | `Millennial-tree-cookie.webp` |

## How to Add Images

### Step 1: Find Cookie Images

Visit the [Cookie Run: Kingdom Wiki](https://cookierunkingdom.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Cookies) to find cookie images:

1. Search for the cookie you want
2. Click on the cookie's page
3. Right-click on the cookie portrait/icon image
4. Select "Save Image As..."

### Step 2: Rename the File

Rename the downloaded image following the naming convention above.

**Example:**
- If you downloaded an image for "Affogato Cookie"
- Rename it to: `affogato-cookie.png`

### Step 3: Add to Images Folder

1. Navigate to `/Users/hmacdermott/Projects/crk/images/`
2. Drop your renamed image file into this folder
3. Refresh your browser - the image will automatically appear!

## Placeholder Behavior

If an image is not found, the app will display a colorful placeholder with the cookie's initials:
- One-word names: First 2 letters (e.g., "HE" for Herb)
- Multi-word names: First letter of first 2 words (e.g., "AF" for Affogato Cookie)

## Tips

- Add images gradually as you need them
- Start with your owned cookies first
- You can batch-download and rename images in your file manager
- No need to restart the app - just refresh the browser after adding images

## Troubleshooting

**Image not showing up?**
1. Check the file name is exactly correct (all lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
2. Make sure the file is in the `/crk/images/` folder
3. Try refreshing your browser with Cmd+Shift+R (hard refresh)
4. Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages

**Image looks pixelated?**
- Download a higher resolution version from the wiki
- Look for the "original file" link on wiki image pages
